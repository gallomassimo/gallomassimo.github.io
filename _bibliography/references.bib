  abstract={Content-centric networking (CCN) brings a paradigm shift in the present Internet communication model by addressing named-data instead of host locations. With respect to TCP/IP, the transport model is connectionless with a unique endpoint at the receiver, driving a retrieval process natively point to multi-point. Another salient feature of CCN is the possibility to embed storage capabilities into the network, adding a new dimension to the transport problem. The focus of this work is on the design of a receiver-driven Interest control protocol for CCN, whose definition, to the best of our knowledge, still lacks in literature. ICP realizes a window-based Interest flow control, achieving full efficiency and fairness under proper parameters setting. In this paper, we provide an analytical characterization of average rate, expected data transfer delay and queue dynamics in steady state on a single and multi-bottleneck network topology. Our model accounts for the impact of on-path caches. Protocol performance is also assessed via packet-level simulations and design guidelines are drawn from previous analysis.},

  abstract = {Live traffic analysis at the first aggregation point in the ISP network enables the implementation of complex traffic engineering policies but is limited by the scarce processing capabilities, especially for Deep Learning (DL) based analytics. The introduction of specialized hardware accelerators i.e., Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), offers the opportunity to enhance processing capabilities of network devices at the edge. Yet, to date, no packet processing pipeline is capable of offering DL-based analysis capabilities in the data-plane, without interfering with network operations. 
  In this paper, we present FENXI, a system to run complex analytics by leveraging TPU. The design of FENXI decouples forwarding operations and traffic analytics which operates at different granularities i.e., packet and flow levels. We conceive two independent modules that asynchronously communicate to exchange network data and analytics results, and design data structures to extract flow level statistics without impacting per-packet processing. We prototyped and evaluated FENXI on general-purpose servers considering both both adversarial and realistic network conditions. Our analysis shows that FENXI can sustains 100 Gbps line rate traffic processing requiring only limited resources, while also dynamically adapting to variable network conditions.},

abstract = {Traffic measurements are key for network management as testified by the rich literature from both academia and industry. At their foundation, measurements rely on transformation functions f(x) = y, mapping input traffic data x to an output performance metric y. Yet, common practices adopt a bottom-up design (i.e., metric-based) which leads to (i) invest a lot of efforts into (re)discovering how to perform such mapping and (ii) create specialized solutions. For instance, sketches are a compact way to extract traffic properties (heavy-hitters, super-spreaders, etc.) but require analytical modeling to offer correctness guarantees and careful engineering to enable in-device deployment and network-wide measurements.},

  abstract={While Deep Learning (DL) technologies are a promising tool to solve networking problems that map to classification tasks, their computational complexity is still too high with respect to real-time traffic measurements requirements. To reduce the DL inference cost, we propose a novel caching paradigm, that we named approximate-key caching, which returns approximate results for lookups of selected input based on cached DL inference results. While approximate cache hits alleviate DL inference workload and increase the system throughput, they however introduce an approximation error. As such, we couple approximate-key caching with an error-correction principled algorithm, that we named auto-refresh.We analytically model our caching system performance for classic LRU and ideal caches, we perform a trace-driven evaluation of the expected performance, and we compare the benefits of our proposed approach with the state-of-the-art similarity caching – this testifies the practical interest of our proposal.},

  howpublished = {/docs/2022HotNets.pdf},
  abstract={Learning the right representations from complex input data is the key ability of successful machine learning (ML) models. The latter are often tailored to a specific data modality. For example, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were designed having the processing of sequential data in mind, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were designed to exploit spatial correlation naturally present in images. Unlike computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), each of which targets a single well-defined modality, network ML problems often have a mixture of data modalities as input. Yet, instead of exploiting such abundance, prac- titioners tend to rely on sub-features thereof, reducing the problem on single modality for the sake of simplicity.
  In this paper, we advocate for exploiting all the modalities naturally present in network data. As a first step, we observe that network data systematically exhibits a mixture of quantities (e.g., measurements), and entities (e.g., IP addresses, names, etc.). Whereas the former are generally well exploited, the latter are often underused or poorly represented (e.g., with one-hot encoding). We propose to systematically leverage state of the art embedding techniques to learn entity representations, whenever significant sequences of such entities are historically observed. Through two diverse use cases, we show that such entity encoding can benefit and naturally augment classic quantity-based features.},
