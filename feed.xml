&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract:&lt;/em&gt; Accurate per-flow monitoring is critical for precise network diagnosis, performance analysis, and network operation and management in general. However, the limited amount of memory available on modern programmable devices and the large number of active flows force practitioners to monitor only the most relevant flows with approximate data structures, limiting their view of network traffic. We argue that, due to the skewed nature of network traffic, such data structures are, in practice, heavily underutilized, i.e., sparse, thus wasting a significant amount of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a Sparse Approximate Data Structure (SPADA) representation that leverages sparsity to reduce the memory footprint of per-flow monitoring systems in the data plane while preserving their original accuracy. SPADA representation can be integrated into a generic per-flow monitoring system and is suitable for several measurement use cases. We prototype SPADA in P4 for a commercial FPGA target and test our approach with a custom simulator that we make publicly available, on four real network traces over three different monitoring tasks. Our results show that SPADA achieves 2√ó to 11√ó memory footprint reduction with respect to the state-of-the-art while maintaining the same accuracy, or even improving it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Massimo Gallo</name><email>first.last@huawei.com</email></author><summary type="html">Our abstract titled ‚ÄúSPADA: A Sparse Approximate Data Structure representation for data plane per-flow monitoring‚Äù will be presented at Conext 2023 Congrats to the team, especially Andrea, Raphael, and Gabriele.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract:&lt;/em&gt; Learning the right representations from complex input data is the key ability of successful machine learning (ML) models. The latter are often tailored to a specific data modality. For example, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) were designed having the processing of sequential data in mind, while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were designed to exploit spatial correlation naturally present in images. Unlike computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP), each of which targets a single well-defined modality, network ML problems often have a mixture of data modalities as input. Yet, instead of exploiting such abundance, prac- titioners tend to rely on sub-features thereof, reducing the problem on single modality for the sake of simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we advocate for exploiting all the modalities naturally present in network data. As a first step, we observe that network data systematically exhibits a mixture of quantities (e.g., measurements), and entities (e.g., IP addresses, names, etc.). Whereas the former are generally well exploited, the latter are often underused or poorly represented (e.g., with one-hot encoding). We propose to systematically leverage state of the art embedding techniques to learn entity representations, whenever significant sequences of such entities are historically observed. Through two diverse use cases, we show that such entity encoding can benefit and naturally augment classic quantity-based features.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Massimo Gallo</name><email>first.last@huawei.com</email></author><summary type="html">Our paper titled ‚ÄúTowards a systematic multi-modal representation learning for network data‚Äù has been accepted at HotNets 2022 Abstract: Learning the right representations from complex input data is the key ability of successful machine learning (ML) models.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract:&lt;/em&gt; While Deep Learning (DL) technologies are a promising tool to solve networking problems that map to classification tasks, their computational complexity is still too high with respect to real-time traffic measurements requirements. To reduce the DL inference cost, we propose a novel caching paradigm, that we named approximate-key caching, which returns approximate results for lookups of selected input based on cached DL inference results. While approximate cache hits alleviate DL inference workload and increase the system throughput, they however introduce an approximation error. As such, we couple approximate-key caching with an error-correction principled algorithm, that we named auto-refresh. We analytically model our caching system performance for classic LRU and ideal caches, we perform a trace-driven evaluation of the expected performance, and we compare the benefits of our proposed approach with the state-of-the-art similarity caching ‚Äì testifying the practical interest of our proposal.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Massimo Gallo</name><email>first.last@huawei.com</email></author><summary type="html">Our paper titled ‚ÄúAccelerating Deep Learning Classification with Error-controlled Approximate-key Caching‚Äù, will be presented at INFOCOM 2022.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract:&lt;/em&gt; Live traffic analysis at the first aggregation point in the ISP network enables the implementation of complex traffic engineering policies but is limited by the scarce processing capabilities, especially for Deep Learning (DL) based analytics. The introduction of specialized hardware accelerators i.e., Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), offers the opportunity to enhance the processing capabilities of network devices at the edge. Yet, to date, no packet processing pipeline is capable of offering DL-based analysis capabilities in the data-plane, without interfering with network operations.
In this paper, we present FENXI, a system to run complex analytics by leveraging TPU. The design of FENXI decouples forwarding operations and traffic analytics which operates at different granularities i.e., packet and flow levels. We conceive two independent modules that asynchronously communicate to exchange network data and analytics results, and design data structures to extract flow level statistics without impacting per-packet processing. We prototyped and evaluated FENXI on general-purpose servers considering both adversarial and realistic network conditions. Our analysis shows that FENXI can sustain 100 Gbps line rate traffic processing requiring only limited resources, while also dynamically adapting to variable network conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Massimo Gallo</name><email>first.last@huawei.com</email></author><summary type="html">Our paper titled ‚ÄúFENXI: Fast in-network analytics‚Äù, will be presented at SEC 2021 2022.
